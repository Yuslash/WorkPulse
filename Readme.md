# **WorkPulse** 🔍👩‍💻👨‍💻

## Project Status: Under Development 🚧

Welcome to **WorkPulse** — the app that lets you keep an eye on employee activity. You know, just in case you were wondering if that "important spreadsheet" was really being worked on, or if someone was actually slacking off watching cat videos on YouTube. 🐱💼

**Disclaimer**: This is *not* a surveillance tool... *Okay, maybe just a little bit.* But it’s for the *greater good*, right? No more wondering if employees are secretly browsing the web while pretending to work. 😉

## What is WorkPulse? 🎯

**WorkPulse** is the app that tracks what your employees are really doing on their computers. From what apps they’re using to how long they’ve been working, **WorkPulse** is here to make sure productivity isn’t just a myth.

You know those moments when you ask yourself: “Are they really working?” Well, now you’ll have the answer. All thanks to the power of *tracking*. (Don't worry, we're not spying, we’re just... *monitoring*. 😏)

---

## Features ⚙️

### In Progress:
- **App Tracking**: Tracks which apps employees are using and how long they’ve been active. So, no more sneaky YouTube sessions during work hours! 📹
- **Clean UI**: Looks sleek and professional because, you know, we’re not just tracking apps, we’re tracking style.
- **Login System**: Secure, so only the right people can see the right data. (Don’t worry, we won’t let your data fall into the wrong hands… unless someone forgets their password.) 🔐
- **Frameless Window**: Because no one needs borders when they’re too busy being productive. 💼
- **Report Generation**: Coming soon — detailed reports so you can feel like a real corporate overlord. 👑

### Coming Soon:
- **Activity Breakdown**: Find out which apps are being overused and which ones are being ignored. (You’d be shocked how many people *still* use Solitaire.)
- **Employee Time Logs**: For the super-serious managers who want to analyze *every* second of an employee’s day.
- **Integrations with Work Tools**: So you can track Slack, Zoom, and more. Because you can’t get away with just “being on a call” anymore.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/workpulse.git
    ```
   
2. Install the required dependencies:

## Usage 📲

- **Employee Tracking**: The app tracks which apps employees are using. For example, if they’ve been on *Instagram* for an hour, you’ll know. 😆
- **Login**: Employees can log in, but they better be productive if they know their activity is being tracked. 💻
- **App Monitoring**: The real-time tracking happens seamlessly in the background, so no one knows they’re being tracked… except they *really* do. 🤫
- **Admin Access**: Admins can check the data, but for now, this is *just* the UI — the backend magic is coming soon.

## About 🧐

**WorkPulse** is still in development, but it’s designed to help employers get a clearer view of how employees are spending their time. From app tracking to work habits, we’re here to make productivity tracking less boring and more efficient.

**Future Developer Note**: We promise to make the backend so complex that you’ll need a Ph.D. just to understand it. 😜 Just kidding... maybe.

**Now, get back to work! Or don't... because we’re watching. 😎**
