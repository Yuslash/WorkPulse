# **WorkPulse** 🤖⚡

## Project Status: Under Development 🚧

Welcome to **WorkPulse** — the app that keeps track of your life, one application at a time. 

**Disclaimer**: This is *not* a new social media app to track your productivity (that’s *definitely* not going to happen). Instead, this is the tool you never knew you needed... to track the applications on your computer. Don’t worry, we’ve got your back! 🖥️💼

## What is WorkPulse? 🚀

You know how your computer sometimes has way too many things running, and it feels like everything is chaotic? Well, **WorkPulse** is the superhero your desktop deserves. 🦸‍♂️🦸‍♀️ 

It helps you keep track of which apps are running, how long they’ve been open, and how much time you're wasting on *Chrome* watching cat videos. 🐱💻 (We won't judge… much.) The best part? This app does not require any of your soul. Only your precious time, but hey, we’re *all* guilty of spending too much time on Netflix, right?

## Features 🧑‍💻⚙️

### In Progress:
- **Application Tracking**: See which apps are running and for how long.
- **Super Cool UI**: Looks great and makes you feel like you’re living in the future.
- **Super Futuristic Button**: You click it, and… magic happens! (Okay, it’s just a navigation thing for now. But still… it’s fancy.)
- **Frameless Window**: Who needs borders? Not us. We’re too cool for that.
- **Dark Mode**: Because who doesn’t love dark mode? 😎

### Coming Soon:
- **Backend Integration**: For those who like things to *actually* work.
- **Data Export**: For all those fancy reports you’ll never look at but will feel great to generate.

## About 🧐

This app is under active development, and things are likely to break, explode, or give you existential questions like, "Am I ever truly productive?" But don't worry — we’re all in this together. 🌈✨

**Future Developer Note**: Please don’t judge my code too harshly. It’s a mix of caffeine-fueled madness and moments of pure genius. 🔥💡

**Enjoy the ride, and remember: WorkPulse is your digital sidekick in this productivity saga. Until it breaks, of course.** 😜
